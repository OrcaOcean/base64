# base64
Fast, robust Base64 encoder/decoder for Buffers in C++. Ignores whitespace. Detects corruption and truncation. Ships with extensive tests, a fuzz test and a benchmark.

## Motivation

Node has native Base64 methods, but these either encode a buffer and return a string (`buffer.toString('base64')`) or decode a string and return a buffer (`Buffer.from(string, 'base64')`). Node currently has no efficient way to encode a buffer as a Base64 buffer without creating an interim V8 String. Node currently has no efficient way to decode a Base64 buffer without creating an interim V8 String. This costs a few hundred megabytes per second of throughput for email servers which send and receive large email attachments. See [issue 11866](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/11866) for more information.

Node also silently ignores obviously corrupted or truncated Base64 data, which is conflated with whitespace or missing padding and handled by Node in the same way. While it is right that whitespace or missing padding should be ignored when decoding, illegal code points or truncated Base64 data should raise an exception to avoid data loss. See [issue 8569](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/8569) for more information.

## Installation

#### Linux, OS X
This will compile the native binding automatically:
```
npm install @ronomon/base64
```

#### Windows
This will skip compiling the native binding automatically:
```
npm install --ignore-scripts @ronomon/base64
```

## Native Binding (Optional)
The native binding will be installed automatically when installing `@ronomon/base64` without the `--ignore-scripts` argument. The Javascript binding will be used if the native binding could not be compiled or is not available. To compile the native binding manually after installing, install [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp) globally:
```
sudo npm install node-gyp -g
```
Then build the binding from within the `@ronomon/base64` module directory:
```
cd node_modules/@ronomon/base64
node-gyp rebuild
```

## Usage

#### Encoding
```javascript
var Base64 = require('@ronomon/base64');
var buffer = Buffer.from('Ecclesiastes 9:11-18', 'utf-8');
var bufferEncoded = Base64.encode(buffer);
console.log(bufferEncoded.toString('ascii'));
// "RWNjbGVzaWFzdGVzIDk6MTEtMTg="
```

#### Decoding
```javascript
var Base64 = require('@ronomon/base64');
var bufferEncoded = Buffer.from('RWNjbGVzaWFzdGVzIDk6MTEtMTg=', 'ascii');
var buffer = Base64.decode(bufferEncoded);
console.log(buffer.toString('utf-8'));
// "Ecclesiastes 9:11-18"
```

## Tests
To test the native and Javascript bindings:
```
node test.js
```

## Benchmark
To benchmark the native and Javascript bindings:
```
